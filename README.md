# bluetoothPairingApp-For-Connecting-Controllers-To-Wearos-like-galaxy-watch-
i needed a way to connect my joycon to my galaxy watch 4. but the built in bluetooth Setting app hides controllers so i ask ChatGPT(i was lazy okay? dont judge) to make this app. i had to patch some of his mistakes but it works perfectly fine(the app does not have a logo [it uses the default one on the watch]). will be added later if ill not forget


1. download the repo or clone it
2. open android studio and files -> import project -> /path/to/WearBtPair/
3. click on build project or run it on the actuall device(it sideloads and installes it)
4. sideload it into watch

# IMPORTANT NOTES!!!!!

the app has no logo so it will use the default one on your smartwatch(in galaxy watches it is a logo of a watch with The letter "i" in his screen)
